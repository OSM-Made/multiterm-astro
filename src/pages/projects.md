## Orbis Suite 3.0

![](../content/OrbisSuite3.png)

The next version of Orbis Suite completely rewritten with a new UI. Now running mostly in userland on the PS4 with its own Daemon process gone is the need for a payload! Fully featured suite of tools to help aid in developing and debugging on the PS4 console. Kind of skipped a version I had worked on at the end of 2021 since I had decided to port this project to WPF from Winforms.
